    <h2>Saliency Thresholds in Neural Code and its Relation to the Power-Law, Gaussian, and Lambert W Function</h2>
    <p class="lede">
      Alex Alvarez*, Jin Hyun Park*, and Yoonsuck Choe
    </p>

    <p>
      Accepted to the <a href="https://www.neurreps.org/">NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Symmetry and Geometry in Neural Representations</a>.
      We epxlore a theoretical juncture where the power law, Gaussian distribution, and Lambert W
      function converge unify the saliency thresholds in neural code.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Lambert W function emerges naturally in instances where exponential processes (like the Gaussian's
      exponentially decaying tails) and polynomial processes (like the power law's polynomially decaying tails)
      meet.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our results point to a biologically plausible invariant property in neural thresholding that could greatly simplify downstream
      processing in visual systems and potentially generalizes across different sensory modalities and
      processing levels.

    <p>
      BeatBreeder is an open-ended creative tool that applies evolutionary computation to sound design.
      Users can evolve unique percussion sounds by selecting their favorites from each generation,
      allowing the system to breed increasingly complex and interesting sonic textures.
    </p>

    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p>
      The system uses CPPNs (Compositional Pattern Producing Networks) to generate audio waveforms.
      Each network takes time as input and outputs audio samples. Through NEAT (NeuroEvolution of
      Augmenting Topologies), the network topology evolves over generations, starting simple and
      growing more complex based on user selections.
    </p>

    <p>
      This approach mirrors biological evolution: mutations introduce variations, crossover combines
      successful patterns, and human aesthetic judgment acts as the selection pressure. The result
      is an exploration of sound space that would be impossible to navigate through traditional
      parameter-tweaking interfaces.
    </p>

      a social-first marketplace platform.

      <figcaption>The platform that connected service providers with local clients.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>The Vision</h3>
    <p>
      Molly &amp; The Mop began with a simple observation: local service providers&mdash;cleaners,
      landscapers, handymen&mdash;often lacked an effective way to reach customers beyond word-of-mouth,
      while customers struggled to find reliable, vetted service providers in their area.
    </p>

    <p>
      We built an online platform that solved both sides of this problem. Service providers could
      create profiles, showcase their work, and receive bookings directly through the platform.
      Customers could browse verified providers, read reviews, and schedule services with confidence.
    </p>

    <h3>Growth & Community</h3>
    <p>
      The company grew to 15+ employees and built a social media following of over 85,000 people.
      We leveraged the same organic content strategy from Volk, but adapted it for the service
      industry&mdash;sharing satisfying before/after transformations, highlighting local providers,
      and building a community around home improvement and maintenance.
    </p>

    <p>
      What started as a simple marketplace evolved into a trusted brand in the Houston area.
      Our social presence drove consistent organic traffic to the platform, and our focus on
      vetting quality providers built trust on both sides of the marketplace.
    </p>

    <h3>The Exit</h3>
    <p>
      In December 2023, we sold Molly &amp; The Mop to a private local cleaning company. They
      saw value not just in the technology platform, but in the community and brand we'd built.
      The customer base, provider network, and social media presence provided them with immediate
      market presence and credibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      This venture reinforced lessons about marketplace dynamics, two-sided network effects, and
      the importance of brand in commodity service industries. It was rewarding to build something
      that genuinely helped local businesses grow while making it easier for people to maintain
      their homes and workspaces.

    <h3>What We Built</h3>
    <p>
      We didn't just sell products&mdash;we built brands with distinct personalities and loyal communities.
      Our approach was unconventional for the time: instead of paid advertising, we focused on creating
      entertaining, shareable content that happened to feature our products. We treated social media
      accounts as entertainment channels first and storefronts second.
    </p>

    <p>
      This strategy paid off. Multiple six and seven-figure exits validated our approach, and the
      methodology we developed through trial and error in the "wild west era" of social commerce
      has since become a standard playbook in the industry.
    </p> -->
<!--
    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
    <p>
      Beyond the financial success, Volk taught me about rapid iteration, understanding audience
      psychology, and building systems that scale. It was a masterclass in pattern recognition&mdash;identifying
      what content would resonate before it went viral, understanding platform algorithms through
      empirical testing, and adapting quickly to changing dynamics.
    </p>

    <p>
      While I'm no longer actively involved in e-commerce, the experience of building something
      from zero to millions of impressions, managing teams, and navigating high-stakes exits has
      been invaluable. It taught me that interesting problems exist everywhere, and that the
      principles of experimentation, measurement, and iteration apply just as well to building
      businesses as they do to research.
