    <p class="lede">

    </p>

    <p>
      We explore a theoretical juncture where the power law, Gaussian, and Lambert W converge to compute saliency thresholds in neural code.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Lambert W function emerges naturally in instances where exponential processes (like the Gaussian's
      exponentially decaying tails) and polynomial processes (like the power law's polynomially decaying tails)
      meet.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our results point to a biologically plausible invariant property in neural thresholding that could greatly simplify downstream
      processing in visual systems and potentially generalizes across different sensory modalities and
      processing levels.

    <h2>Interactive Evolutionary Platforms</h2>
    <p class="lede">
      Exploring open-ended evolution through human-guided selection. What emerges when
      we combine neural networks, genetic algorithms, and aesthetic judgment?
    </p>

    <h3>SynthBreeder</h3>
    <p>
      An interactive evolution platform for generating percussion sounds using CPPN-NEAT
      (Compositional Pattern Producing Networks with NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies).
      Unlike traditional synthesizers with fixed parameters, SynthBreeder explores an open-ended
      space of possible sounds through evolutionary computation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Users select sounds they find interesting from each generation, and the system breeds
      increasingly complex variations. The underlying CPPNs start simple and grow more intricate
      over time, discovering sonic textures that would be impossible to design manually. Each
      network topology is unique, encoding audio waveforms through compositions of mathematical
      activation functions.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h3>AblOEh</h3>
    <p>
      A 3D evolutionary fashion design platform that generates dresses through a combination
      of explicit trait-based genetics (hemline, silhouette, waist width) and neural networks
      that control color, texture, and surface detail. Click on any design to breed the next
      generation from its DNA.
    </p>

    <p>
      The system demonstrates how explicit designer controls can coexist with emergent complexity.
      Users can lock certain traits (shape, pattern) while allowing others to evolve, or apply
      designer overrides (force asymmetric hemlines, strict symmetry) to guide evolution toward
      specific aesthetic directions. The result is a hybrid approach where human creativity
      and algorithmic exploration work in tandem.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each dress is a phenotype expressed from a genotype containing both parametric traits
      and a CPPN that evaluates color and displacement at every vertex. The evolutionary
      process mirrors biological systems: mutations introduce variation, selection pressure
      comes from human aesthetic judgment, and complexity grows organically over generations.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>→ <a href="../openendedness/ablOEh.html" style="color: #4CAF50; text-decoration: underline;">Try AblOEh</a></strong>
    </p>

    <h3>On Open-Endedness</h3>
    <p>
      These platforms explore a fundamental question in artificial intelligence and creativity:
      how do we build systems that can discover genuinely novel solutions rather than optimizing
      toward predefined goals? Traditional optimization has a target; open-ended evolution has
      only interesting-ness as defined by the observer.
    </p>

    <p>
      By placing humans in the selection loop, we create a co-creative process where the
      algorithm explores possibility space and humans provide the fitness function through
      their choices. What emerges is often surprising—solutions neither purely human-designed
      nor purely algorithmic, but a synthesis that neither could achieve alone.

      From December 2019 to December 2023 I built multiple e-commerce brands that collectively achieved over 100 million impressions and millions of organic followers across social media platforms.

    <h2>Molly &amp; The Mop</h2>
    <p class="lede">
      Connecting commercial and residential service providers with clients through
      a social-first marketplace platform.

      </div>
      <figcaption>The platform that connected service providers with local clients.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>The Vision</h3>
    <p>
      Molly &amp; The Mop began with a simple observation: local service providers&mdash;cleaners,
      landscapers, handymen&mdash;often lacked an effective way to reach customers beyond word-of-mouth,
      while customers struggled to find reliable, vetted service providers in their area.
    </p>

    <p>
      We built an online platform that solved both sides of this problem. Service providers could
      create profiles, showcase their work, and receive bookings directly through the platform.
      Customers could browse verified providers, read reviews, and schedule services with confidence.
    </p>

    <h3>Growth & Community</h3>
    <p>
      The company grew to 15+ employees and built a social media following of over 85,000 people.
      We leveraged the same organic content strategy from Volk, but adapted it for the service
      industry&mdash;sharing satisfying before/after transformations, highlighting local providers,
      and building a community around home improvement and maintenance.
    </p>

    <p>
      What started as a simple marketplace evolved into a trusted brand in the Houston area.
      Our social presence drove consistent organic traffic to the platform, and our focus on
      vetting quality providers built trust on both sides of the marketplace.
    </p>

    <h3>The Exit</h3>
    <p>
      In December 2023, we sold Molly &amp; The Mop to a private local cleaning company. They
      saw value not just in the technology platform, but in the community and brand we'd built.
      The customer base, provider network, and social media presence provided them with immediate
      market presence and credibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      This venture reinforced lessons about marketplace dynamics, two-sided network effects, and
      the importance of brand in commodity service industries. It was rewarding to build something
      that genuinely helped local businesses grow while making it easier for people to maintain
      their homes and workspaces.

          As I work on RL and neuro-evolutionary agents and environments, it's hard not to notice the parallels between simulation-building and society-building.
          I’ve experienced first-hand how bright and experienced AI researchers frustratingly achieve the exact behavior that they designed but not the one that they intended.
          I believe that the closer we get to understanding how systems work at scale (e.g., how historical context influences culture, how human psychology manifests in macroeconomics),
          the better we can create systems that help the world towards a common goal.
